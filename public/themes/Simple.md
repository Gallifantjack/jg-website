**Build Wealth with your Mind, not your Time.**
Wealth creation should not be about renting out your time but owning equity. 
Strive for independence rather than money. 
The aim is to uncouple your inputs from your outputs and strive for financial freedom. 
It is essential to learn how to sell and build. 
Creating wealth requires delivering what people want but donâ€™t know how to get, at scale.
