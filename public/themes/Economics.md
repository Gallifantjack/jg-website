**Don’t confuse what you wish were true, with what is really true.**
Truth means an accurate understanding of reality. 
Although we wish that we see things clearly. 
We see events through the window of our emotions and previous experiences. 
Yet, to make better decisions it is important not to get hung up on how things “should” be. 
Because then we miss out on learning how they really are. 
Decision-making is a two-step process (first learning and then deciding). 
The biggest threat to good decision-making is harmful emotions. 
Don’t mistake opinions for facts. 
Reconcile emotions with logic. 
Then only act when they align to make better decisions.
