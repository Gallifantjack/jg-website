**Remain balanced in the face of external events and thoughts.**
Certain aspects of life are within our control. Some are not. 
Happiness and success are predicated upon focussing on actions we can control. 
Then directing those actions towards serving something or somebody we care about. 
The ability to choose our responses to situations and thoughts is critical. 
We can choose to be unaffected by praise or criticism. 
'Choose not to be harmed and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed and you haven't been.' 
Your value is in and of yourself. You remain no better or worse. Unless you decide to feel that way. 
‘Is anything improved by praise or damaged by contempt? 
Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires it?’
